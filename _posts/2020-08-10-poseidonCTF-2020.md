# DB64:

## Writeup;

As there in description, I have started checking firefoxhistory and chromehistory.
Checking chromehistory I got these;

![db64 firefox history](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47820151/91738781-a4450b00-ebce-11ea-9e7e-63106c773f98.png)


So I've gone to that link and downloaded the zip which contained a .kbdx file.
The thing is .kbdx files are supported/opened by keepass [a password manager] which requires master key for sure.
Now I've started searching for a password in **envars,cmdscan,cmdline,consoles,files...**
Intially using **clipboard** plugin Ive got something like this;

![clipboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47820151/91738873-c2127000-ebce-11ea-89a5-888ea95517cc.png)

The thing which is there in clipboard didn't worked as password so let's keep that a side and try to get password.
After sometime I went through description and there they mentioned about passwords.
Intially I have used **hashdump** gave me hashes but the hashes mentioned there were uncrackable.
So my teammate used **mimikatz** which will display passwords in ascii form.
The output is as follows;

![password](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47820151/91738974-e2422f00-ebce-11ea-812a-2b6173f44a5c.jpeg)

Now this password also didn't work. Coming back to clipboard we suspected that we mighe have to use pastebin.
But in pastebin which message to open? And this password seemed to be part of the link using that we get a list of words like this.

![pastebin1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47820151/91739047-fede6700-ebce-11ea-968a-f3d438b432a2.png)

So this seems like a wordlist. Using this we managed to crack Database.kbdx through john.
After cracking database.kbdx and opening it we get to see 5 or 6 usernames and passwords again all of those passwords are links of pastebins. 
After checking all of them one with username "EY" gave us useful info. Using that as link we will get;

![pastebin2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47820151/91739131-1ddcf900-ebcf-11ea-8c86-363a39ac4a93.png)

This is base64 encoded image. We managed to get the image and it has the flag;
The flag is: **Poseidon{F1ref0x_P1ugIns_V0latI1Ity}**.

This is one of the best and cool challenges I've ever done.
Thanks to @iwd and @asis...

## Writeup;

After reading the Description, I thought there will be something in firefox history as one of the authors like firefox and uses it as per the description.
But There is nothing over there and "google" is mentioned. So I've tried chromehistory and got results as follows. 

![Screenshot from 2020-08-12 01-50-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47820151/89995547-75c2b880-dc3e-11ea-8493-1c83936e9749.png)

By going to that link It's pastebin link and we see there is a file which has Malware.exe in it.
As the Description suggests we have to find which ip address and port number that Malware.exe is connecting to.
So we can run the Malware and capture the packets using Wireshark.
During analysing we can see there is a http

So we can see that it is connected to 23.97.198.147 and port no.32847
from that link if we open, it returns the flag; **Poseidon{HUhu'R3G0OD4tD1gG1nG}**
